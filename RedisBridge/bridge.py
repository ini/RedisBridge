class RedisBridge:
    """
    A bridge class for handling connections to Redis as an internal bus.

    Example usage:
    
    1. Create a RedisBridge

    >>> bridge = RedisBridge(host='localhost', port=6379)

    2. Create clients (that implement `receive_redis(message)`)

    >>> client1 = MyClient()
    >>> client2 = MyOtherClient()

    3. Register clients with various channels

    >>> bridge.register(client1, 'belief')
    >>> bridge.register(client2, 'disalignment')

    4. Start the bridge to begin receiving messages

    >>> bridge.start()

    5. Messages can be constructed and sent to Redis:

    >>> bridge.send(belief_state, 'belief', should_pickle=True)

    6. Stop the bridge to stop receiving messages

    >>> bridge.stop()
